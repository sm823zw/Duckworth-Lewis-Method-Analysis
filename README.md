# Duckworth-Lewis-Method-Analysis

This repo deals with approximating/fitting 'runs production function' using the first innings data of ODI matches and obtaining the curves used in the DL method used in cricket to set revised targets in games shortened due to rain/bad light. The dataset contains data of ODI games between 1999 and 2011. Mean Squared Error was the cost function used.

Here, two models for runs production function were considered which were functions of 'overs to go' and 'wickets in hand'.
